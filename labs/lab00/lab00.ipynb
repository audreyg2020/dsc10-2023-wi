    "Welcome to DSC 10!  Each week, you will complete a lab assignment like this one. You can think of the labs as being hands-on, interactive reading assignments where you'll get practical experience with the topics from lecture. In a given week, the lab will prepare you for the homework assignment, so make sure to work on the lab first. \n",

    "Each person must submit each lab independently, but you are encouraged to discuss the lab with other students (no sharing code). If you get stuck at any point during the lab, make sure to look through the lecture notebooks and readings linked on the course website. You can also post on EdStem or come to office hours (check the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar) on the course website for the schedule).\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's lab will cover the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one)\n",
    "* Write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, a popular programming language\n",
    "* Call *functions* to use code that other people have written\n",
    "* Break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it\n",
    "* Work with another type of data: text\n",
    "* Invoke methods and import code\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab references [BPD 1-6](https://notes.dsc10.com/01-getting_started/tools.html) in the `babypandas` notes; make sure to check them out, especially if you run into trouble."
