    "Welcome to Homework 2! This week, we will cover DataFrame manipulations, making visualizations, and defining functions. You can find additional help on these topics in  [BPD 6, 9-12](https://notes.dsc10.com/01-getting_started/functions-defining.html) in the `babypandas` notes and [CIT 7-7.3](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/07/Visualization.html) in the textbook."

    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please do not use for-loops for any questions in this homework.** If you don't know what a for-loop is, don't worry – we haven't covered them yet. But if you do know what they are and are wondering why it's not OK to use them, it is because loops in Python are slow, and looping over arrays and DataFrames should usually be avoided."

    "Hmm... perhaps there's a bit more to diamond pricing than just depth percentage! Jack explains that there are four common measures of the quality of a diamond, sometimes called the 4 C's: `'carat'`, `'cut'`, `'clarity'`, and `'color'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The `'carat'` simply measures the weight of the diamond. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The `'cut'` is related to the depth proportion, and is considered either Ideal, Premium, Very Good, Good, or Fair (in descending order of quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The `'clarity'` describes whether the diamond has any flaws. In descending order of quality, the values of `'clarity'` in our dataset are `'IF'` (which stands for \"internally flawless\"), `'VVS1'`, `'VVS2'`, `'VS1'`, `'VS2'`, `'SI1'`, `'SI2'`, and `'I1'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=images/clarity.jpg width=400>\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.petragems.com/education/diamond-clarity/\">source</a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The `'color'` of each diamond in our dataset is described by a letter between `'D'` and `'J'`, where '`D'` represents a diamond with no color, and `'J'` represents a diamond with some color to it. Diamonds with less color are considered higher quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=images/color.jpg width=200>\n",
    "<a href=\"https://bashertjewelry.com/pages/diamonds-color-grading\">source</a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'carat'` column of `diamonds` contains numerical data, but the columns for the other 3 C's contain ordered categorical data. Since the data has an order to it, we can convert the values in those columns into numerical values, to make for easier comparisons. For example, if we assign all the values of `'J'` in the `color` column to 1, all the values of `'I'` in the `color` column to 2, etc., we'll more easily be able to search for diamonds where the color is better than an `'F'` (we could search for color values greater than 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of `'cut'`, `'clarity'`, and `'color'`, let's translate the data from categorical values to numerical values. For all three of these quality measures, we'll use the number 1 to represent the lowest quality category, and we'll count up from there by one for each category. For example, the numbers for `'clarity'` will range from 1 (for `'I1'`-rated diamonds) to 8 (for internally flawless, or `'IF'`-rated diamonds).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.4.** Create three functions, called `cut_numerical`, `clarity_numerical` and `color_numerical`, where each function takes in a string value describing the categorical quality for the `'cut'`, `'clarity'`, or `'color'`, respectively, and outputs the corresponding numerical value, as described above.
