    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (the schedule can be found [here](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. "

Strings have another method that we haven't seen yet, called `join`. `join` takes one argument, an array of strings, and it returns a single string. Specifically, `some_string.join(some_array)` evaluates to a new string consisting of all of elements in `some_array`, with `some_string` inserted in between each element.\n",
