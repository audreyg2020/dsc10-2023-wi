Hi! My name is Jasmine and I'm a second year data science major from the Bay Area. I'm excited to be tutoring this class as it is one of the first courses in the data science track and I'd like to help students really understand the core concepts. When I'm not working towards my academic goals, you can find me making new spotify playlists, going on boba runs, and trying not to burn my apartment down with my cooking skills. Feel free to drop by office hours, I'm looking forward to meeting everyone!
