Hi! My name is Vanessa and I'm a second-year Data Science major from the Bay Area. This is my first time tutoring, but I'm excited to help everyone start out their journey in data science. In my free time, I like to bake, go sightseeing, and binge-watch TV shows. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions and I can't wait to meet everyone in my OH!
