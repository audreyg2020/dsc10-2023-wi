Hello, and welcome to DSC 10! My name is Dylan (but feel free to just call me Dyl), and I'm a fourth year Data Science major with minors in Cognitive Science and Mathematics from Orange County! I truly believe that DSC 10 is an exciting and rewarding course for how it teaches us to uncover meaningful insights from datasets filled with seemingly random numbers and text. This will be last my quarter as an undergrad (making it all the more special), so I'm looking forward to meeting you all!
