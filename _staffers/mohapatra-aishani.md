Hello hello! My name is Aishani and Iâ€™m a third year Data Science major and Biology minor from the Bay Area. I'm interested in the intersection of medicine and data science and think it's super cool how much you can find out about organisms (or things) through seemingly random data. Outside academics, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, going to the beach, and doing anything outdoorsy and adventurous. Looking forward to meeting everyone! :)
