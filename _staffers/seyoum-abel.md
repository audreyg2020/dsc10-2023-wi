Hi! My name is Abel Seyoum and I am a third year Data Science student from San Diego. This is my first time tutoring DSC 10 and I am very excited to get to know and assist all of you to the best of my abilities this quarter! Outside of coursework, I typically am surfing local breaks, or playing either basketball or soccer. I am looking forward to working with you all, and please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have!
