Hey, my name is Linda Long and I am excited to meeting all of you and solving problems together! I am a second year undergrad with junior standing. I major in Applied Mathematics and minor in Data Science. I love traveling, fitness and enjoying good food. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)
