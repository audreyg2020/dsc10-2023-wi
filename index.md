The first course meeting will be remote ([Zoom link here](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97623586285)) because Janine has Covid. Several subsequent lectures may also be remote for the same reason. Check this page for updates about when we'll be able to start in-person instruction. Thanks for your understanding!
